This is a simple beamer poster template that only uses `theme_pics/` and does
not depend in any way on other files in this repo. It lives here because it
shares the same design elements. Those were extracted from existing pptx
templates. This template only sets header and footer elements. The rest of the
poster is a single beamer `frame`.

A more aligned way to create a poster template is to modify the existing one in
this repo to provide an option to switch between poster and slides.
